Lua profiler
uses my lua parser

usage: luajit -lprofile -lscript-to-run

operates by
first overriding the require function
next, for lua files, parses them, 
inserts profiling calls into beginning of blocks
and recompiles

still TODO:
associate ast tokens with line/col, so anonymous functions can be traced back to their origin
